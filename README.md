# AlexNet-Tensorflow-Implementation

I implemented AlexNet in Python and TensorFlow on CIFAR10 dataset for Lehigh University Deep Learning CSE398 course final project.

Dataset was procured using "https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz" so you need to be online.

==========================================================

AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network, originally written with CUDA to run with GPU support, which competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge[1] in 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points ahead of the runner up. AlexNet was designed by the SuperVision group, consisting of Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ilya Sutskever. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)
